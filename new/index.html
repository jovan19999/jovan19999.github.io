      <p>Lebron James is the greatest basketball player of all time. He has won 4 NBA championships, and 4 final MVPS. Also he has won 3 regular season MVPS.</p>

      <p>As much of a great athete he is, he is also influencer in other people's lives. He opened up a whole school for kids in the place he grew up in, Akron, Ohio. He is trying to have a big impact on kid's lives by presenting how a real athlete should act and behave both on and off the court.</p>

      <p>He is debated to be the greatest player of all time along with Michael Jordan. A lot of people are agreeing with that fact, but also a lot are disagreeing. He is known for a player who turns bad players into good ones, and good ones into great ones. That is his biggest value.</p>

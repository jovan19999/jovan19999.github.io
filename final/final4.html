          <p>At the end of 2020/21 season, Nikola Jokic was rewarded as the Most Valuable Player in the NBA. he became the first center to win the award since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000 as well as the first player in Denver Nuggets franchise history. He also became the first Serbian player, third European player overall, and sixth international player to ever win the award. Having been selected 41st overall in the 2014 NBA draft, Jokić became the lowest-drafted player in NBA history to be named MVP, as well as the first-ever player to be drafted in the second round of the common draft era (since 1966) to win the award. In that season, he averaged 26.4 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game.</p>

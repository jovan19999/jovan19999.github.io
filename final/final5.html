   <p>Jokic back in Serbia wasn't very good. The people saw a talent in him, but he definetely wasn't any different from other players back there. He was usually not even the best player on the floor when his team was playing. He was considered as a fat, soft, crafty player who was limited due to his athletic and physical abilities. Denver Nuggets saw  a big potential in him, and decided to draft him in 2014, making a plan where focus will be to mostly work on his body and physical strenghts, since (according to Nuggets) he had every other aspect of the game within him.</p>
